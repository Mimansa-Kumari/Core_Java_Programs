Task 1-	Write an algorithm to calculate the discount if the total bill amount is greater than or equal to $500 and display the discounted amount.
Get the total bill amount from the user.

Task 2-Convert the algorithm to Pseudocode.



Task 1- Algorithm

step 1- Start
step 2- Accept Total bill Amount from User
step 3- If the total bill amount is greater than or equal to 500 than
		calculate the 5% of the Total bill amount and display the discounted Amount.
step 4- If the total bill amount is less than 500 than 
		display the discounted amount as 0.
step 5- Stop



Task 2- Pseudocode

. BEGIN
. GET Total Bill Amount as T_Bill
. If (T_Bill>=500)
	BEGIN
		SET Discount=(5/100)*T_Bill
		PRINT Discount= +Discount
	END
  ELSE
	BEGIN
		PRINT Discount= 0
	END
. END
