CHALLENGE-2


Task 1- Write an algorithm for the given problem statement

Algorithm

Step 1- START
Step 2- Accept Minimum value from User as Min_Value
Step 3- Accept Maximum Value from User as Max_Value
Step 4- Initialize a variable Sum as 0
Step 5- For range between Min_Value and Max_Value check each number if it is Prime or not
Step 6- If it is Prime than add the number in Sum
Step 7- Repeat step 4 & 5 till the number becomes equal to the Max_Value
Step 8- Print the Sum 
Step 9- STOP


Task 2- Write the Pseudocode for the given problem statement


Pseudocode

. BEGIN
. GET Minimum Value as Min_Value
. GET Maximum Value as Max_Value
. SET Sum =0
. FOR i=Min_value to Max_Value step 1
	FOR j=2 to i step 1
	    if(i%j==0)
		 BEGINIF
			Sum=Sum+i
		 ENDIF
	ENDFOR
  ENDFOR
. PRINT Sum of the Prime Numbers is +Sum
. END
